# My portfolio website
 
Welcome to my python portfolio, `a small website I built to showcase what skills I have learned through my coding journey.

Instructions:
1. Download the project files from my github or clone the repository. 

2. Create and run a virtual environment within the project file and install the required libraries and packages as listed in the requirements.txt file. 

3. Run app.py from the terminal. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser and navigate the website. 

What I've learned:
This project has been a great learning experience and an intro into the backend of web development. I had a lot of fun furthering my HTML/CSS and Python knowledge!
